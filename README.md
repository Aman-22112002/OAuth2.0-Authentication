2. Encrypted password storage for enhanced security.
3. Flexible authentication options (username/password and Google Sign-In).
4. User-friendly login interface.
5. Error handling and validation for a seamless user experience.
6. Spring Boot framework for rapid development and deployment.
 
Prerequisites:
1. Java 8 or later
2. Spring Boot 2.x or later
3. Required Spring Boot dependencies (e.g., Spring Security, Spring Data JPA, Spring Web)
4. A supported database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL)
5. Google Cloud Platform credentials (for Google Sign-In)
